"All I wanted to say," bellowed the computer, "is that my circuits are now 
irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of 
Life, the Universe, and Everything -" he paused and satisfied himself that 
he now had everyone's attention, before continuing more quietly, "but the 
programme will take me a little while to run."

Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.

"How long?" he said.

"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought.

Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.

"Seven and a half million years ...!" they cried in chorus.

"Yes," declaimed Deep Thought, "I said I'd have to think about it, didn't 
I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to 
create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of 
philosophy in general. Everyone's going to have their own theories about 
what answer I'm eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on 
that media market than you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing 
with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular 
press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that 
sound?"

The two philosophers gaped at him.

"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. Here 
Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?"

"Dunno," said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, "think our brains must be too 
highly trained Majikthise."

So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a 
lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams.

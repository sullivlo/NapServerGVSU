# What Sample Users?

Each of these "SampleUser_" directories and their included files represent what each client would have on their computers.

Still to be developed, the client that connects to the Central Server would read from their XML document to send the data related to each of their files that they are making available to the P2P network. In this process of the client-program reading from the XML document, there could be validation of these files existing within the same directory before sending that information to the Central Server. This validation could either function to (1) throw error and freeze the client before trying to connect with the Central Server, or (2) notify the user of the error, but simply send the information that *is* valid.

## Big Thanks
